# The PDA Cabinet Archive
The PDA Cabinet Archive is a collection of applications for Pocket PC Windows Mobile devices with mainly the ARM and MIPS architecture while still having some SH3 and SH4 apps

The first release is scheduled around December of 2022 or January of 2023, following sequential updates.

EDIT: Due to multipul factors the archive will be limited to ARM only unless someone can supply a dump of CABs for SH3, SH4 and MIPS. Sorry
