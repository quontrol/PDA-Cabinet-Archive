# The Mobile Cabinet Archive
The ARM Cabinet Archive is a collection of applications for Pocket PC Windows Mobile devices with the ARM architecture.

The first release is scheduled around December of 2022 or January of 2023, following sequential updates.

EDIT: Due to multipul factors the archive will be limited to ARM only unless someone can supply a dump of CABs for SH3, SH4 and MIPS. Sorry
