# The PDA Cabinet Archive

The PDA Cabinet Archive is a large collection of applications for Windows Mobile Pocket PCs and Palm-Sized PCs (Sometimes abbreviated as Palm PC).

The Apps and Games in this archive are for mainly for ARM, but some MIPS, SH3/SH4, and x86 (if I could find it) are shoved in there too.

The first release is scheduled around December-ish of 2022 following sequential updates every 2 months.
